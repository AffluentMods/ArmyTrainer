# Army Traininer
*Army Trainer* is an unfinished project solo developed by Affluent Mods. Army Trainer was originally planned on releasing *March 15th, 2022* 
It's a PvP focused base builder with multiple activites and features; Raiding players to obtain a multitude of resources, training different types of troops for raiding 
[Infantry, Ranged, Calvary, Siege, Traps]. Along with a campaign questline used for expanding your base and knowledge. You could also research different tech to
unlock better troop tiers, and increase your economy efficiency. 

## Source Code
Code is NOT finished. The backbone should be fully functioning, database, voting, etc.
* Get a database server and change the IP | Password | User inside the *Database.java* file
* Change the Bot's token in *Bot.Java*
* Change the Top.gg's info in *Constants.java* (for voting), or leave blank if you don't want voting.
Recommendation: Get a discord bot up for Army Trainer, and go through the different commands

## Status
Sadly effective April 14th, 2022; Withering officially shutdown permanently, along with all other projects cancelled. Source code was released publicly, free to use however you want.
